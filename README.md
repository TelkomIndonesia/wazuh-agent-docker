# wazuh agent docker image

A workaround to start wazuh agent from docker container. Inspired by <https://zwischenzugs.com/2015/06/24/the-most-pointless-docker-command-ever/>. See [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) or [wazuh-daemonset.yaml](./wazuh-daemonset.yaml) for deployment refference.

.n.b: it is only tested in debian based host
